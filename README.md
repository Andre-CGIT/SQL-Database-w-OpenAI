# SQL-Database-w-OpenAI
Testing Ai agents/ modeling with SQL 

Additional I wanted to add the function of this Ai Agent and SQL database into a desktop app for windows. Once I decide on the SQL database I would like to use then I will plug in the URL for said database and re-enter my openai key to run test for its function.
